# Process Diagnostics - Executive Summary

## Requirements Summary

proconly solves a common production debugging problem: you've exec'd into a
minimal container (Alpine, distroless, scratch) and need to understand what's
running. There's no package manager, no network, no strace, no lsof—just
busybox.

Engineers can paste the script into any Linux container and immediately see all
running processes with their state and command lines. For deeper investigation,
the tool shows open file descriptors including network sockets with full address
resolution (TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, listening vs connected, local and remote
endpoints).

The tool is designed for hostile environments: it handles permission errors
gracefully (showing what's accessible rather than failing), survives process
churn (processes starting/stopping during execution), and works with the most
limited shell environments (POSIX sh, busybox utilities only).

## Technical Summary

proconly parses the Linux `/proc` filesystem directly—no external tools required.
Process discovery iterates numeric directories under `/proc`. Process metadata
comes from `/proc/[pid]/stat` (state), `/proc/[pid]/cmdline` (arguments), and
`/proc/[pid]/comm` (fallback name).

File descriptor enumeration reads `/proc/[pid]/fd/` symlinks. Socket resolution
cross-references socket inodes against `/proc/net/tcp`, `/proc/net/tcp6`,
`/proc/net/udp`, `/proc/net/udp6`, and `/proc/net/unix` to extract protocol,
state, and address information. IPv4 addresses are converted from hex to dotted
decimal notation.

The script is pure POSIX sh with busybox-compatible awk for parsing. Total size
is kept under 400 lines for reliable copy-paste deployment.
